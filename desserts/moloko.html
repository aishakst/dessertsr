  <li>Prepare the dough.
Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt with a mixer for 3-4 minutes until fluffy.
Without stopping to whisk, gradually add the condensed milk.</li>
  <li>Mix the flour with the baking powder, sift and add in batches to the egg mixture, stirring with a mixer.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
Line a baking dish with parchment or silicone mat and grease with a little butter. Send half of the dough to the form and distribute it in a thin even layer. Bake the cake at 180 degrees for 6-7 minutes until tender. Bake the second cake in the same way.</li>
  <li>Trim the edges of the cakes. Separate the cakes from the parchment or silicone mat and cool.</li>
  <li>Divide the cooled cakes into four pieces each.
Spread a little cream on the bottom of a baking dish to hold the cake together well.
Assemble the cake, smearing each cake with 1-2 tablespoons of cream. Top and sides of the cake also generously smear cream.
Put the cake in the fridge for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Decorate the cake as desired</li>
</ol>
